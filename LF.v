Inductive day : Type :=
    monday
  | tuesday
  | wednesday
  | thursday
  | friday
  | saturday
  | sunday.

Definition next_weekday (d:day) : day :=
  match d with
    monday    => tuesday
  | tuesday   => wednesday
  | wednesday => thursday
  | thursday  => friday
  | friday    => monday
  | saturday  => monday
  | sunday    => monday
  end.

Compute (next_weekday friday).
Compute (next_weekday (next_weekday saturday)).

Example test_next_weekday:
  (next_weekday (next_weekday saturday)) = tuesday.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.

Inductive bool : Type :=
    true
  | false.

Definition negb (b:bool) : bool :=
  match b with
    true  => false
  | false => true
  end.

Definition andb (b1:bool) (b2:bool) : bool :=
  match b1 with
    true  => b2
  | false => false
  end.

Definition orb (b1:bool) (b2:bool) : bool :=
  match b1 with
    true  => true
  | false => b2
  end.

Example test_orb1: (orb true false) = true.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.
Example test_orb2: (orb false false) = false.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.
Example test_orb3: (orb false true) = true.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.
Example test_orb4: (orb true true) = true.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.

Notation "x && y" := (andb x y).

Example test_orb5: false || false || true = true.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.

Definition andb3 (b1:bool) (b2:bool) (b3:bool) : bool :=
  match b1, b2, b3 with
    true, true, true => true
  | _, _, _          => false
  end.
